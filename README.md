# RSA-variants
Comparative Analysis between different RSA variants
1. RSA
2. Efficient RSA 
3. Dependent RSA
4. Shared RSA
5. Carmichael RSA
6. Multi Prime RSA
7. Multi Power RSA
8. Common Prime RSA
9. Chinese Remainder Theorem RSA


Requirements and Installation:
Python - 3.8.3
libraries - pycryptodome (https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/)

Note : Efficient RSA algorithm does not work because author has provided invalid formulaes and examples in base paper (doi : https://doi.org/10.1109/ITNG.2008.199) which proves Efficient RSA algorithm is useless.
